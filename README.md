Computes virtually scanned signed distance fields for an object.

### Installation
The code was developed under VS2013.

Requirements:
- DirectX SDK June 2010
- our research library [mLib](https://github.com/niessner/mLib)
- mLib external libraries can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fve3uen5mzonidx/mLibExternal.zip?dl=0)


### To Run:
[`zParametersDefault.txt`](zParametersDefault.txt) defines the parameters for the virtual scanning. An example can be run using [ShapeNet.v2](https://shapenet.org/) to generate a scanned SDF of the chair in [`example_chair.txt`](example_chair.txt)
